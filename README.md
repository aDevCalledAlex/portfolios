## About
This application was created in a semester of Software Engineering (ICSI 418Y at the University at Albany) by: 
* Jonathon Eckman @jeckman213 (graphs, stock API, comparison page), 
* Sam Peck @SamPeckCodes (style sheet, brochure), 
* Luis Fermin @luis14fermin (help page),
* Alex Passidomo @aDevCalledAlex (everything else). 

Nobody had any web, nor group, development experience before this project; an immense amount was learned in these areas and more.
